# Incident Management System (IMS)
##### Notes for Blackrock 3 talk at DevOpsDays Amsterdam, 27.06.2018

---

**T**one
                      - Set the tone, focus people on the incident
**I**nteraction
                      - Control interaction, precise language
**M**anagement
                      - Commanding does not have to be one of the experts!
                      - Managing the process in order to get experts to work is vital
**E**ngagement
                      - Make sure to engage the right people

It's about:
- mission-criticality
- time = money
- direction, focus, clarity with 1 person in charge

There are no good or bad news, but **just news**. Signs and symptoms are verifiable and **actionable**. Save the root cause for later. Restore service first. Focus on solving the problem on hand, not the consequences.

-> Org charts will (culturally) change.

-> Solve problems by function, not by person.

-> After-Action-Review

-> Keep your MTTA (Mean-Time-To-Assemble) low

### Customer communication

**C**onditions
                - What's happening?
**A**ctions
                - What's being done?
**N**eeds
                - What are the needs?

- Consider the consumer
- Adjust messaging
- Distill information
- Don't ask for questions

-> Rinse and repeat during action

---

### Incident Commanding

  - Delegate!
  - Keep track
  - Think forward
  - 'Take care' of people and personalities
  - Span of Control should be 5-7 people (but will be more probably)

  ```

          ----------------------
          \    Description     /  What
           \  --------------- /
            \    Explain     /  Why
             \ ------------ /
              \   Solution /  How
               \ ---------/
  ```

#### Basic Span of Control:

```
                      Incident Commandment
                              |
    Liaison Officer ----------+------- Communications/Docu
                              |
           +------------------+-----------------+
           |                  |                  |
          Team lead 1    Team lead 2         Team lead 3
           |                  |                  |
      ... -+
           |
      ... -+
```

- Communications does all the inter-org communication
- Liaison: shield IC in order for them to do the work (has more weight than Communications)
- Team leads report!

=> Incident resolution is a **people to people activity**

=> Make the **right** decision in the **shortest** amount of time
